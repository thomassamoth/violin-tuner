Project we did a few years ago to create a violin tuner, based on a Raspberry Pi.

The initial project was inspired by the [Roadie Tuner](https://www.roadiemusic.com/) (made for guitars) and divided into 3 parts :

1. Find the **frequency** played by the violin
2. Turn the **motor** to reach the desired frequency
3. User **Interface** using a RGB LED

> **Note**  
This part of the project can be used by itself and doesn't need the other ones.  

## Dependencies

To use this program and install packages,  simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## List of features to add

- [X] Put the recording inside a function to loop it
- [X] Add more precision for a frequency to be detected
- [ ] Make a function to verify harmonics (if an harmonic is louder than the fundamental, just divide it and apply the error
- [ ] Add precisions in the error message when the wrong note is selected (e.g. the note played is closer to a 'E')
- [ ] Relaunch the program when the note is wrong (instead of stopping it directly)  
- [ ] Reverse the program to give the note associated with the played frequency
